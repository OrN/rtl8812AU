# rtl8812AU
Realtek 8812AU USB WiFi driver

This is a fork, with various patches to compile against latest kernels (tested up to 4.15.0)

branch 5.2.20 is using driver 5.2.20 + patches to add support of 8821au

Note: this merge may not work. Some functions are missing...
By the way, maybe no worth the work. Realtek seems to only love to rework existing code (rename variables, move functions, mess the indentation, change structure names and members etc) with very little usefull work/fixes....
